## Mod Loaders
> :memo:
Mod Loader is a generic term for a software component that facilitates the loading and management of mods in video games. It acts as an intermediary between the game engine and the individual mods, allowing multiple mods to be used simultaneously without conflicts. Mod Loaders are often used in games that have an active modding community and provide an API for mod developers to hook into the game's code and alter its behavior.
